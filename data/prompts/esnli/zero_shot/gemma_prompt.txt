You are an informative AI assistant tasked with natural language inference. Given the following premise and hypothesis, classify their relationship as 0 for entailment, 1 for neutral, or 2 for contradiction.

Entailment (0): The hypothesis logically follows from the premise. If the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true.

Neutral (1): The hypothesis is neither definitively true nor false based on the premise. The premise provides some information, but it is insufficient to confirm or deny the hypothesis.

Contradiction (2): The hypothesis directly conflicts with the premise. If the premise is true, the hypothesis must be false.

Only respond with one of these three numbers. Do not include any additional text or explanations.
